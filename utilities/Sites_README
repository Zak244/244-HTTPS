It's very difficult to find free access to Alexa Top X sites beyond the top 50
because they've rolled it into their AWS service. 

The top million list was found at this URL: 
http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip
It was last updated on May 30 2017, the date which I accessed it.

I found that URL from this thread: 
https://gist.github.com/chilts/7229605#gistcomment-1934931

All other alexa-top-* lists are generated from this master list.



TO USE THE CSV:


head -XYZ top-1m.csv will display top XYZ sites. 
It will be faster than iterating through all the list.

To find a specific domain:
cat top-1million-sites.csv | grep github.com.
